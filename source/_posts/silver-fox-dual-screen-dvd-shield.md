The Silver Fox
------
We recently purchased a new 2018 Nissan NV 3500 SL passenger van that I've taken to calling the "Silver Fox". With the addition of our twins we simply couldn't fit all 6 kids reasonably into the Honda Odyssey anymore. I confided in friends that watching my wife pull up at the school to unload kids one day was the final straw for me. As kids crawled out from under the two rear facing twin car seats, it reminded me of a clown car packed with an endless stream of children.

We needed a new car.

One of the major drawbacks to a 12-passenger van is the lack of entertainment options. Most of the people I spoke with recommended something as simple as individual iPads or tablets. One of the things we really try (and sometimes fail miserably) at, is to limit individual kid screen time on electronic devices. We'd much rather have kids watching a movie and laughing together from the back seat than glance back and see kids heads down playing Flappy Bird all day.

Requirements
------
1. 2 different entertainment "zones" to allow for older and younger kids to enjoy different programs
2. HDMI input screens so that device playing content can be removed or replaced later
3. DVD capable but not primary use case
 * We really were tired of renting / burning / buying DVDs only to have them scratched, lost or even broken
 * We evaluated a number of DVD / HDMI monitors but in the end decided to go with a DVD player that also featured HDMI inputs
 * The logic was that if on a long road trip, something stopped working with the setup we would be able to find a Walmart and buy an on sale DVD or two.
4. Capable of playing media from a USB or SSD hard drive loaded with MKV files from our at-home library
5. Ability for the older kids to watch content from the younger zone if they chose to
6. Ability to turn off sound and video from the drivers seat (video / audio mute)

**_MOST IMPORTANT_**: just like a good software project this all needed to be designed, purchased, and installed in 2 weeks before we left for a 15 hour drive to Colorado for Spring Break. #fun

Design Notes
------

I tested a number of HDMI monitors from Amazon / eBay and in the end decided on a smaller (10.1") Alpine DVD player. I'm not sure why I didn't just pick the Alpine in the first place but here's what I tried first.

* I purchased 2 x 13.3" HDMI monitor that while new in packaging, had LCD screens with a number of scratches on them. The weight of these was also problematic, my installer wasn't entirely sure they would hold properly without sagging
* I purchased 10.1" Audiovox DVD players but after reading through the install manual awaiting their arrival, realized they needed some kind of 12-pin to HDMI adapter cable in order to use the hidden HDMI input on the device. This proprietary cable was of course sold out and so I would have been forced to use the second HDMI input on the side of the device, looping the HDMI cable out from the headliner and into the side of the unit (not ideal).
* Finding dual-channel IR monitors, or at least ones that I was confident were in fact dual-channel was challenging with the Chinese imported screens.

I had originally decided to purchase the Gaming edition Shield to allow the older kids to possibly play games on the device but this proved to be more difficult than anticipated on mobile hotspot tethering. The gaming controller however is a much better interface for the younger kids to use than the handheld remote

The Alpine PKG-RSE3HDMI comes with (2) Single Source IR Headphones. I needed to order the Dual Source model above separately and didn't realize this until 2 days before departure. When the twins are older, they will be able to use the second set of Single Source IR headphones so this actually worked out nicely.

I need to move from a 1x2 HDMI Splitter to a 1x3 or 1x4 HDMI splitter on the front display for the younger kids. They have a touch time navigating the Shield menu from time to time and so outputting that signal into the back of the Alpine head unit installed up front, would allow the passenger to use the Shield remote from the front seat to select a new movie to watch.

Plex Configuration
------
I could write another post on this topic alone (and very well may). This worked really well until I disconnected the Shield units from the Wifi. Suddenly, they couldn't display anything from the library unless I turned on the Wifi Hotspot on my cell phone and let them authenticate to plex.tv.

To workaround this I did a couple of things:
1. I connected each Nvidia Shield to my iPhone hotspot
1. I then connected to the web console of each Plex Media Server on the individual Shield devices (http://172.20.10.{10/11}:32400/web)
1. Settings -> Network -> Show Advanced
1. **LAN Networks**: 10.0.0.0/8, 172.20.10.0/24 -> Save Changes
1. Settings -> General -> Sign Out
1. Connect a crossover cable between Shield A and Shield B and manually configured a static IP address:
* IP: 10.1.35.{2,3} / 255.255.255.0
* GATEWAY: -blank-
* DNS: -blank-

This finally allowed the individual Plex clients on Shield A and Shield B to play content from their own library, as well as from each other. I tested two streams from a single Plex server and had no playback or transcoding issues.
